    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the QuotelyAI app  for mobile devices that was created by AKDroid Labs  as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
      <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages</li>
      <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Access</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Quote Generation (Gemini API)</h2>
    <p>
      The Application uses Google's <strong>Gemini API</strong> to generate AI-based motivational and creative quotes.
      When you use features like "Generate Quote", your entered text (prompt) is securely transmitted to Google servers
      for processing by the Gemini API, and a generated response is returned to your device.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider does not store or log any user-entered prompts or generated responses on its own servers.
      All data exchanged with Gemini API is handled according to 
      <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AI Terms of Service</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Gemini API may temporarily log data to improve the quality and reliability of AI models, as stated in
      Google’s official documentation. However, AKDroid Labs and the QuotelyAI Application do not have access
      to your Gemini API interaction history.
    </p>

    <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
    <p>You can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the app. You may use standard uninstall processes available on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider will retain user-provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. For data deletion requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:quotelyai.team@gmail.com">quotelyai.team@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider takes reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. You are advised to review this page regularly for updates.</p>
